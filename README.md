ü§©Pizza_Sales_SQL Project

The Pizza Sales Data Analysis Project helps understand how well pizza sales are doing using SQL. This project aims to give useful information to make better decisions in areas like managing inventory, planning sales strategies, and understanding customer preferences. By looking at different parts of pizza orders and revenue, the project finds important trends and patterns in the sales data.

‚úÖProject Features

The project includes several features. It calculates the total number of orders to understand how many pizzas are sold overall. It also calculates total revenue to see how much money the business is making and identifies the highest-priced pizza to recognize premium products. The project determines the most common pizza size ordered to help manage stock and lists the top five most popular pizzas along with their quantities to highlight customer favorites. It finds the total number of pizzas ordered in each category to understand which types are most popular and determines the distribution of orders by hour to know the peak times for pizza orders
